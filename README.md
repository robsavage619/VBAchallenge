# VBA-challenge-RRS

The code written for the VBA Challenge takes data from multiple years of stock exchange data to determine a few key takeaways from each particular year
 
 The data points outlined are as follows:
 
 
 Yearly Change: measuring the opening stock price the beginning of the calendar year against the final closing price at the end of the year. 
 
 Percent Change: this measures the size of the differential of the opening and closing prices in a more digestible form.
 
 Total Stock Volume: this aggregates the entire year's worth of volume into one large figure. Giving the user an idea of size of the stock in question.
 
 
 This program can be run on large to small data sets and help users gather snapshots in a significantly shorter amount of time. 
 
 Built with: Excel VBA
